# Cookbook app

App uses Spoonacular API for recipes https://spoonacular.com/food-api.

Allows to:
- Filter recipes according to time, cuisines, meal type and diets
- Search of recipes
- For each recipe displays: time, servings, instructions, ingredients, diets

**NOTE**: Please bear in mind that Cookbook cannot work in offline mode as it needs connection to retrieve recipes from Spoonacular API. This API is free only for limited number of requests and therefore will not work after these requests are exceeded.
